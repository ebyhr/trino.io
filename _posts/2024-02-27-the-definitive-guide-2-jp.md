Do you know where the name 'Trino' comes from? It's actually a shortened form of
'neutrino'. These fast and lightweight subatomic particles have recently made
their way to Japan. You can now reserve your copy of the Japanese edition of
[Trino: The Definitive Guide]({{site.url}}/trino-the-definitive-guide.html)!

Today, we are happy to announce that the Japanese translation of the book
[Trino: The Definitive Guide]({{site.url}}/trino-the-definitive-guide.html) is
available for the communities all across Japan and far beyond. Preorder today
and get your copy from the first batch in the middle of March. Hopefully it can
lower the barrier to Trino for native speakers. We invite you all to get your
own copy:

We hope many readers can benefit from the translated edition.

We look forward to chatting with many of our new readers and Trino users on the

channels, and direct messaging.
